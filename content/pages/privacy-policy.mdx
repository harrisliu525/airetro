## What we collect

- Account information such as name, email, and workspace details.
- Uploaded photos, prompts, and captions required to generate retro renders.
- Usage data including preset selections, export formats, and integration events.

## How we use data

We use your information to operate the service, provide support, improve model quality, and send important product updates. We never train public models on private customer uploads without explicit permission.

## Photo retention

Original uploads remain encrypted and are deleted automatically after 30 days unless you store them in a preset collection or connected storage bucket. Generated assets remain until you delete them or request workspace removal.

## Sharing information

We share data with trusted subprocessors such as cloud infrastructure providers and payment processors. They are bound by strict confidentiality and security obligations.

## Your rights

You can request export or deletion of your data at any time by contacting privacy@ai-retro.com. Enterprise customers may sign data processing agreements and select regional hosting.
