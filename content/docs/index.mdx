## Step 1: Create your workspace

Sign up with email or Google, pick a workspace name, and invite teammates who need access to retro presets.

## Step 2: Upload your first photo

Use a high resolution PNG or JPG. The uploader guides you through cropping, focus selection, and optional restoration.

## Step 3: Choose a preset

Browse the Style Library or search by decade. Click preview to generate a low-resolution test before committing credits.

## Step 4: Customize the output

Add background prompts, adjust grain strength, set aspect ratio, and turn on captions or date stamps.

## Step 5: Export and share

Download 4K PNGs, social ready MP4 loops, or send assets directly to Canva, Shopify, and Printful through integrations.
