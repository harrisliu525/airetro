## Configuration

Pass in two image sources: the original photo and the AI Retro output. The toggle handles crossfade animation and drag interactions.

## Copy suggestions

Label the default state as "Original" and the transformed state with the preset name to reinforce branding.

## Performance

Lazy load secondary images and provide fallbacks for browsers without pointer support.
