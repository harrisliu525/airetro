## When to use

Tabs work best when you need to present several presets, pricing options, or integrations without stacking long sections.

## Content strategy

Limit tabs to five items. Highlight one as the default recommendation and include supporting media or bullet lists inside each tab.

## Customization

Adjust typography, underline styles, and animations in the tab component configuration.
