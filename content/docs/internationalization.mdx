## Enable localized presets

In workspace settings, toggle **Localization** to access region tags. Choose your default market so presets load with matching typography and captions.

## Translating captions

The caption builder supports localized handwriting fonts, date formats, and slang. Select a language, add tokens like {city}, and preview before export.

## Regional compliance

Enterprise workspaces can restrict processing to specific regions and disable prompts that conflict with cultural guidelines.

## Request a new market

Contact support with mood boards, brand references, and target demographics. Our team prioritizes new packs based on demand and available training data.
