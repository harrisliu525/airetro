## Adjust preset parameters

Every preset exposes controls for grain strength, color warmth, vignette, and border width. Use the preview toggle to compare before and after.

## Adding custom prompts

Provide short prompts describing background, props, wardrobe, or mood. Combine them with preset modifiers to keep results on brand.

## Using restoration mode

For scans or low-light images, enable Restoration to clean dust, rebalance color, and lift shadows before styling.

## Saving brand presets

After dialing in a look, click **Save as brand preset**. Give it a name, assign tags, and decide if colleagues can edit it.

## Batch generating variations

Creator and Studio plans include batch generation for up to eight variants. Use this to test poses, expressions, or background changes quickly.
