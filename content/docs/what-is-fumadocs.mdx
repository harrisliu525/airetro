## Core modules

- **Style Library:** Browse curated presets organized by era, medium, and mood.
- **Retro Studio:** Upload assets, apply presets, and export in multiple ratios.
- **Background designer:** Swap scenes using prompts or library backdrops.
- **Caption builder:** Generate localized handwriting and metadata.

## Credit system

Each HD render consumes one credit. Pro and Studio workspaces include monthly allowances and the option to buy add-on packs.

## Workspaces and roles

Owners manage billing, admins set presets and integrations, and members generate imagery. You can monitor usage in the dashboard.

## Integrations

Connect Canva, Shopify, Printful, Zapier, Google Drive, and Dropbox to automate delivery. Enterprise plans support custom webhooks.

## Security and compliance

AI Retro encrypts uploads in transit and at rest, purges originals after 30 days, and offers regional data residency for regulated industries.
