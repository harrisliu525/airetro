## Caption editor basics

Use plain text or markdown-style emphasis (**bold**, *italic*) inside the caption editor. The handwriting engine converts these styles into legible strokes.

## Dynamic tokens

Insert tokens such as {year}, {city}, {name}, or {product}. Tokens pull from workspace data or prompt inputs at render time.

## Multi-line captions

Use two spaces at the end of a line to force a handwritten line break. Keep lines under 38 characters for readability on small borders.

## Accessibility tips

Add descriptive alt text when exporting to social channels and ensure color contrast between text and background meets accessibility standards.
