## 1. Provision your workspace

Create a workspace, set billing info, and disable auto-invite so you can control access manually.

## 2. Add identity providers

Studio plans support SSO via SAML or OAuth. Upload metadata, map roles, and test with a pilot group.

## 3. Configure storage

Connect your preferred cloud storage bucket if you must retain originals beyond the default retention window.

## 4. Set up webhooks

Register webhook endpoints to receive render completion events, audit logs, and credit usage updates.

## 5. Validate presets

Before launching, run acceptance tests for each brand preset to confirm color accuracy, caption formatting, and export sizes.
