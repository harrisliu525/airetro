## Upload your palette

Add hex values for primary, secondary, and accent colors. The system maps them to highlight, midtone, and shadow adjustments.

## Palette overrides

For each preset choose whether to enforce brand colors or let the original palette shine. Preview toggles show the impact instantly.

## Testing palettes

Use the A/B testing tool to compare engagement metrics across different palettes. Record results in the analytics dashboard.

## Sharing palettes

Export palettes as JSON or share them with partner agencies so every channel keeps the same look.
