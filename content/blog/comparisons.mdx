## Why creators compare AI Retro and manual editing

Brands love the control of Photoshop and Lightroom, but nostalgia campaigns move fast. AI Retro was built to deliver era-specific portraits in seconds without losing quality. This article breaks down when to rely on AI and when manual retouching still shines.

## Speed and consistency at scale

Manual retouching can take 45 minutes per image and every edit depends on the designer's mood. AI Retro analyzes lighting, applies decade-accurate grain, and exports 4K files in under 15 seconds. Teams stay on schedule and the look stays consistent across hundreds of assets.

### Feature comparison

| Workflow | AI Retro | Manual editing |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Turnaround time | 10-15 seconds | 30-60 minutes |
| Era accuracy | Pre-trained decade presets | Depends on designer reference |
| Background control | Prompt based swaps and library scenes | Masking and compositing required |
| Caption styling | Built-in handwriting fonts | Manual text creation |
| Collaboration | Shareable brand presets | Layer files or long guides |

## When manual editing still wins

Manual editing is perfect for complex composites, heavy illustration, or projects that demand bespoke brushwork. We often see teams generate base imagery in AI Retro, then add typography or motion in their standard creative suite.

## Recommended hybrid workflow

1. Generate retro portraits in AI Retro with the correct aspect ratio and preset.
2. Export layered PNGs and send them to your design app via integrations.
3. Add illustration, type, or collage elements manually where the AI cannot infer context.
4. Feed successful manual tweaks back into AI Retro's prompt library so the system learns your brand preferences.

## Key takeaways for your next campaign

- Use AI Retro for speed, consistency, and accurate film simulation.
- Layer manual edits when you need complex composites or brand-specific art direction.
- Document your favorite prompts and adjustments so the entire team can reuse them.
