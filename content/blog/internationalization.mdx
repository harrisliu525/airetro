## Why localized nostalgia matters

A retro look that resonates in Tokyo will not always land the same in Paris. We study cultural references, fashion history, and pop media to adapt AI Retro presets for each market.

## Region-specific style packs

- **Japan:** Soft film pastels inspired by Showa era family photos.
- **United States:** Bold 80s neon with mall lighting and arcade reflections.
- **Latin America:** 90s novela vibes with warm interiors and analog grain.
- **Europe:** 70s editorial looks with muted palettes and timeless tailoring.

## Translating captions and typography

The caption builder now supports multilingual handwriting fonts, localized date formats, and meaningful slang suggestions. Teams can preview how copy reads before exporting assets.

## Compliance and data residency

Enterprise customers can pin generation to specific regions so portraits stay within required jurisdictions. We also surface cultural guidelines inside each preset to avoid insensitive combinations.

## Launch roadmap

We are prioritizing Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and francophone Africa next. Request access to the localization beta if you need to ship campaigns in those regions.
