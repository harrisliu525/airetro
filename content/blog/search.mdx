## Start with vibe keywords

Search for mood-driven keywords like "mall", "film noir", or "desert road trip" to surface presets with matching lighting and props. Each result includes sample outputs so you can preview before generating.

## Filter by campaign needs

Use the filter drawer to sort by:
- **Decade:** 50s through Y2K.
- **Medium:** Film, VHS, Polaroid, or magazine editorial.
- **Orientation:** Square, portrait, landscape, or poster.
- **Color profile:** Warm, cool, monochrome, or duotone looks.

## Save favorites to collections

Click the bookmark icon to add presets to collections such as "Holiday drop" or "Spring lookbook." Collections sync with your team so everyone stays aligned.

## Combine presets and custom prompts

After selecting a preset, add optional prompts like "city skyline at dusk" or "bubblegum signage" to give the AI extra context. Saving these combinations as brand presets keeps your output consistent.

## Pro tip

If you are unsure which preset fits, generate low-resolution previews first. Once you pick a direction, switch to 4K exports and batch multiple variations for quick comparison.
