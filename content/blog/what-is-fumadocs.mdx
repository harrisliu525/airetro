## The mission

AI Retro exists so any creator can deliver authentic retro visuals without renting gear or mastering Photoshop. We combine machine learning, color science, and a global team of artists to deliver consistent nostalgia at scale.

## Core features

- **Style Library:** 40+ presets from 1950s film to Y2K camcorder aesthetics.
- **Retro Studio:** Upload photos, choose a preset, and export 4K images in seconds.
- **Background designer:** Replace scenes with arcades, diners, concerts, or custom prompts.
- **Caption builder:** Generate handwritten notes, dates, and localized slang.

## Built for teams

Share brand presets, manage credits, and integrate with your existing tools. AI Retro connects to Canva, Shopify, Printful, Zapier, and more so your workflow stays seamless.

## Who uses AI Retro

Creators, marketing teams, photographers, educators, and gift shops use AI Retro to launch nostalgia campaigns, personalize memorabilia, and revive archives.
