## Building an era-aware dataset

AI Retro learns from licensed photo archives, museum collections, and on-set shoots we capture in-house. Each image is tagged with era, lighting type, wardrobe, camera format, and social context so the model understands the nuance behind every look.

## Color science tuned for nostalgia

We profile real film stocks and video formats, from Kodachrome to MiniDV, to recreate accurate tone curves. During training we apply color calibration targets and grain samples so renders feel cinematic instead of over-processed.

### Guardrails that keep styles authentic

- **Rights-first sourcing:** Every reference carries clear usage rights.
- **Bias audits:** Reviewers score diversity across skin tones, body types, and cultural representation.
- **Prompt stress tests:** We challenge the model with edge cases to avoid stereotypes or hallucinated props.

## Human review loop

Before a new preset ships, creative directors and photographers evaluate 200+ renders across skin tones and scenes. Their feedback flows back into the training pipeline so future versions keep improving.

## What is next for the model

We are expanding into early 2000s camcorder looks, adding motion-aware blur, and opening the Style Lab so enterprise teams can fine tune private presets. Follow the changelog for release dates.
