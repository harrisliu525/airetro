## Color drives memory recall

Neuroscience shows that people associate specific color combinations with personal memories. Warm oranges and browns trigger 70s living rooms, while electric blues and magenta scream 80s synthwave.

## Palettes we recommend

| Era | Primary palette | Works best for |
| --- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 1950s | Soft teal, buttercream, cherry red | Family portraits, diners |
| 1970s | Mustard, burnt orange, avocado | Fashion lookbooks, furniture drops |
| 1980s | Electric blue, neon pink, chrome | Tech launches, nightlife promos |
| 1990s | Indigo, sunflower, forest green | School nostalgia, lifestyle brands |

## Customize with color controls

AI Retro lets you tweak highlight tint, midtone warmth, and shadow saturation. Adjust sliders to match your brand guidelines while keeping the retro feel.

## Testing palette performance

Run A/B tests with our analytics integration or export variants to your ad platform. Track click-through rate, watch time, and save rate to learn which palettes resonate with your audience.

## Keep a palette library

Document your winning combinations in the brand preset panel. When new teammates join, they can launch a campaign without guessing which colors your audience loves.
