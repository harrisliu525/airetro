## Start with a clean source photo

Good lighting and focus give the AI more detail to work with. Shoot near a window or use soft studio lights so the subject is evenly lit and faces the camera.

### Recommended file specs

- Resolution: at least 2000px on the shortest side.
- Format: PNG or JPG, 8-bit sRGB color space.
- Size: under 12 MB for fast uploads.
- Background: neutral or solid colors make masking easier.

## Portrait best practices

Ask your subject to hold a relaxed expression, keep shoulders visible, and avoid hair covering the eyes. AI Retro can add era-accurate makeup and accessories if the base image is clear.

## Product photography tips

Place items on plain surfaces, shoot at a slight angle, and capture a little negative space so retro borders and typography have room. If the product is reflective, add a diffuser to soften highlights.

## Upload workflow checklist

1. Export your photo with the specs above.
2. Upload to AI Retro and select the preset that fits your campaign.
3. Review the auto crop and adjust focus on faces or key objects.
4. Add optional prompts for background, props, or caption details.
5. Save the preset if you plan to re-create the look later.

## Bonus: prepping scans

For old prints, scan at 600 DPI, remove dust with canned air, and crop out ripped edges. Enable Restoration mode in AI Retro to revive faded colors before applying the new style.
